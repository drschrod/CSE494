Running the code:
To run the code, please add the entire folder into your 'Paths' variable in MATLAB.
You can do this by clicking on 'Set Paths'. After that, please execute the Demo1.m script.

What you will see:
When running the code, you will be prompted to provide three positions. Position 1 is the
start position of the agent. Position 2 is the goal position of the agent. Position three
is the position of a ball. If you place the ball between the start and goal of the agent,
you will see how it moves once it collides with the agent.

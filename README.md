# CSE494-Seating-Sim
##Robotics

The purpose of this project is to simulate (in Matlab) a loading/filling up of a theater with assigned seating as well as randomized seating

## Demo of Code

[Demo 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n014uIq4rYA)

### Running code

Open the code in MatLab and add paths.
Open and run the Test.m file in the folder



## Troubleshooting:

Ensure all the path's are set and if you receive any errors, run the individual files separately to clear cache (and also enter clear classes in the command line tool in Matlab)

To have the sim run faster, disable vis circle functions or anything that draws a circle, recently discovered that the circles are actually very memory intensive and horrendously implemented.

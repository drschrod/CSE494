# CSE494-Seating-Sim
Robotics

The purpose of this project is to simulate (in Matlab) a loading/filling up of a theater with assigned seating as well as randomized seating


To run the code currently, run the file testingstuff.m

Ensure all the path's are set and if you receive any errors, run the individual files separately to clear cache (and also enter clear classes in the command line tool in Matlab)
